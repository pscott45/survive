# survive
The object of the game is to survive. The space button fires the weapon. Use buttons 1, 2, and 3
to cycle through the different weapons. The weapons only become available once they are picked 
up. Weapons, ammo, and star power will periodically spawn throughout the game. Star power renders
the player invincible. G button throws a grenade and B button releases the bomber.
